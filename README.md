# DNA Sequencing RNN Model
This project focuses on classifying DNA sequences from humans, dogs, and chimpanzees using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately analyze DNA sequences and predict the species they belong to.

## ðŸ”¬ Potential Applications
* Genomic Research: Identify species based on genetic data.

* Medical Diagnostics: Detect genetic disorders by analyzing DNA sequences.

* Bioinformatics: Classify DNA sequences from different organisms.

* Forensic Science: Identify species from DNA samples in crime investigations.

**Step 2: Data Loading & Preprocessing**
* Loaded DNA sequence dataset using the os library.

* Performed data preprocessing including:

* Label encoding of species

* Reshaping sequences for neural network input

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

**Step 3: Model Building & Training**
* Constructed a hybrid model using:

   * 1D CNN for extracting spatial patterns in DNA sequences

   * Bidirectional GRU for capturing long-range dependencies in both directions

* Trained the model using the preprocessed dataset

**Step 4: Model Evaluation**
* Visualized:

    * Training vs. Validation Loss

    * Training vs. Validation Accuracy

* Evaluated the modelâ€™s learning progress and potential overfitting/underfitting

**Step 5: Testing & Prediction**
* Performed testing on unseen DNA sequences

* Made predictions and evaluated the modelâ€™s generalization ability

## ðŸ“Š Confusion Matrix & Metrics
* To better understand the modelâ€™s performance, we use classification metrics:

* Precision: Measures how many of the predicted positive samples are actually correct.

* Recall: Measures how many actual positive samples were correctly predicted.

* F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall â€” ideal for imbalanced datasets.

* Support: The number of actual samples per class in the test set.
