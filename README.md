# DNA-Sequencing-RNN-Model
This project classifies DNA sequences from humans, dogs, and chimpanzees using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Bidirectional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). The goal is to build a model that can analyze DNA sequences and predict the species they belong to.

**Potential Applications**

*   **Genomic Research:** Identify species based on genetic data.
*   **Medical Diagnostics:** Detect genetic disorders by analyzing DNA sequences.
*   **Bioinformatics:** Classify DNA sequences from different organisms.
*   **Forensic Science:** Identify species from DNA samples in crime investigations.

**steps use in this project are:**
* **Step1** = Import all important libraries.
  In  this project i use libraries like numpy , pandas , matplotlib , sklearn , tensorflow , keras and scikeras.

* **Step2** = Data loading and preprocessing. for data loading i use os library so i load the data set by giving the path.
  after loading data i perform preprocessing like encoding , reshaping and split of data.

**All about Confusion matrix**
1. Precision
Measures how many of the predicted positive instances were actually correct.

2. Recall
Measures how many of the actual positive instances were correctly identified.

3. F1-Score
The harmonic mean of precision and recall. Useful when you want a balance between precision and recall.
â€‹
4. Support
The number of actual instances in the dataset for each class.
